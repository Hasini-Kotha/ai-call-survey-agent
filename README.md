 AI Call Survey Agent

An AI-powered automated call survey system that conducts real-time, conversational voice surveys using Large Language Models.  
The agent dynamically adapts questions based on user responses and schedules outbound calls automatically.

Built for real-world customer feedback collection.

 Features

- **Automated Voice Calls** using Twilio
-  **Real-time Conversational AI** powered by Groq LLM
-  **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** via Twilio
-  **Dynamic Question Flow** based on product type and user responses
-  **Scheduled Outbound Calls** using background cron jobs
-  **Firebase Firestore** for call scheduling and status tracking
-  **Flask-based Backend API**

 How It Works

1. Phone numbers and call schedules are stored in **Firebase Firestore**
2. A background cron scheduler checks for due calls every minute
3. When a call is due:
   - Twilio initiates an outbound call
   - The call connects to the Flask `/voice` webhook
4. User speech is converted to text (STT)
5. The text is sent to **Groq LLM**
6. AI generates the next context-aware question
7. Response is converted back to speech (TTS)
8. The conversation continues dynamically until completion
